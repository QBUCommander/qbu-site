    "description": "The Null Zone is the vibrational underworld of the Quantum Body Universe—a murky, unstable dimension formed from emotional suppression, psychic fragmentation, and resonance leaks. It exists beneath the psyche like a heavy shadow—always present, rarely acknowledged.\n\nIt is not evil, but it is dangerous. A psychic sinkhole, a magnetic pit for anything disowned, denied, or dissociated. It feeds off emotional imbalance, numbness, and unresolved frequencies.\n\nWhere VICKY represents aligned evolution, the Null Zone is what happens when resonance is abandoned.\n\nTime here is not a spiral, a wave, or a braid. It's a tangle—a jumbled mess of broken loops, corrupted memory-threads, and void echoes.",
